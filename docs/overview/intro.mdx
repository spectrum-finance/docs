## What is Spectrum Finance?

Welcome to the Spectrum Finance docs!

**Spectrum Finance** is a cross-chain decentralized trading protocol (DEX).


The unique feature of Spectrum Finance is that it is built on the multichain network called **Spectrum Network**.  
**Spectrum Network** is a 'side-chain' with its own nodes and consensus protocol, just like all blockchains. The main difference is that it exists for a specific narrow purpose - to validate and process cross-chain operations. It is designed in such a way as to allow the exchange or swap of native assets (e.g. ADA → ETH, BNB → ERG) without requiring wrapping. The following diagram illustrates the entire cross-chain system.

## DeFi problems that Spectrum Finance aims to solve

Classical DeFi applications like Uniswap have shown promising results in regard to features and decentralization but also revealed essential limitations of the approach which most of the present dApps are built upon. Those limitations fall into two major categories:

1. **Low capital efficiency** which is caused by Miner extractable value ([MEV](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/miner-extractable-value-mev)),  [arbitrage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/arbitrage-opportunities-in-defi) and liquidity segmentation;
2. **Poor user experience** which is caused by high fees and long confirmation times (i.e. low throughput).

There are more significant issues with DeFi overall than this particular problem. The bigger issue is that there is no fully decentralized tool available for exchanging one native asset for another (such as ETH for ADA). This lack of decentralization greatly increases the cost of the transfer in terms of both money and risk. Users have to rely on centralized (CEXes) and semi-centralized tools (bridges) as intermediaries to achieve their goals.

The design of the Spectrum Finance protocol is built in such a way as to provide a secure, fast and cheap exchange of native currencies and tokens without any intermediary. The protocol is fully open-source, trustless and decentralized, meaning no one has to trust their funds to a dubious party.
