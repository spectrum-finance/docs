accomplish this, locate your liquidity pool on the [liquidity page](https://app.spectrum.fi/ergo/liquidity), navigate to
the "Pool Overview" section, and click the "**•••**" button to access the available options. From there, select the "Lock
liquidity" option and follow the steps provided by the interface.
