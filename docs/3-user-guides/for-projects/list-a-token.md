This article is titled 'List a token' to make it more comprehensible. In reality, Spectrum Finance is an open and decentralized platform that enables anyone to create liquidity pool with any token.

This document explains how to display your token's logo on the platform. Please follow the instructions provided in the [`default-token-list`](https://github.com/spectrum-finance/default-token-list) repository to display your token logo on the Spectrum Finance interface.
