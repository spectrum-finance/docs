# Liquidity Locker

## Introduction

To help protect our users, ErgoDEX is introducing a Liquidity Locker feature.
This feature can be used by the teams of developers willing to hold an IDO to lock the desired portion of liquidity in the ErgoDEX pool for a desired period.

Liquidity Locking is a widely used practice in IDOs on DEX's like Uniswap where developers can use a separate application such as Unicrypt to lock their liquidity. ErgoDEX brings the tool to a new level of convenience. Liquidity Locking is fully integrated into the ErgoDEX UI making ErgoDEX a first class platform for IDOs.

## Why lock liquidity

If at the start of an IDO a team decides to lock some significant amount of liquidity of their pool for a reasonable period, it gives confidence to the investors that the locked liquidity stays in the pool until a certain blockchain height (blocks) is reached, creating trust-based relationships between both sides.

### 1. Lock Liquidity

Below are the sequnce of steps a project will need to follow in order to lock liquidity in a liquidity pool.
