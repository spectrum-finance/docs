4. Once you have entered a value, the bottom button will allow you to proceed to the next screen detailing the swap. Here you can see the total fees and expected crypto you will receive from the swap. Once you choose swap, the dapp connector will popup, you need to enter a password to sign and confirm.

6. Once the transaction has been submitted, a user can check the status by clicking on the clock icon. Inside here, a user can check the current status of the swap and open the transaction on the blockchain.
