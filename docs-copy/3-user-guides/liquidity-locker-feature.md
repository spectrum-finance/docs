# Liquidity Locker

## Introduction

To help protect our users, Spectrum Finance is introducing a Liquidity Locker feature.
This feature can be used by the teams of developers willing to hold an IDO to lock the desired portion of liquidity in the Spectrum Finance pool for a desired period.

Liquidity Locking is a widely used practice in IDOs on DEX's like Uniswap where developers can use a separate application such as Unicrypt to lock their liquidity. Spectrum Finance brings the tool to a new level of convenience. Liquidity Locking is fully integrated into the ErgoDEX UI making ErgoDEX a first class platform for IDOs.

## Why lock liquidity

If at the start of an IDO a team decides to lock some significant amount of liquidity of their pool for a reasonable period, it gives confidence to the investors that the locked liquidity stays in the pool until a certain blockchain height (blocks) is reached, creating trust-based relationships between both sides.

### 1. Lock Liquidity

Below are the sequnce of steps a project will need to follow in order to lock liquidity in a liquidity pool.
