# Introduction

## What is Spectrum Finance?

Spectrum Finance is a non-custodial decentralized exchange that allows a quick, effortless, and secure
transfer of liquidity inside and between the Ergo and Cardano networks. The eUTXO model gives the unique possibility to have shared
liquidity among different networks. Spectrum Finance will eventually feature a full AMM, Order Book and more.

Spectrum Finance is an open-source DeFi product which take a part in both Ergo and Cardano platforms and as a
consequence exists for purposes of both communities. You can imagine Spectrum Finance infrastructure like the following:

- **Spectrum Labs:** the team of developers who are developing and maintaining Spectrum Finance protocol, user interface and other
  products;
- **The Spectrum Finance Protocol:** a set of smart contracts that create an automated market maker and order book;
- **Spectrum Finance User Interface (UI):** a web (or mobile) interface which provides access in conjunction with the protocol;
- **Spectrum Finance Execution Bots:** off-chain software whose function is to execute DEX orders and works in a completely
  decentralized manner.
